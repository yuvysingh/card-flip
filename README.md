# card-flip

memory card flip game made in VANILLA JS 

I was inspired to create this because I enjoy playing a similar game on quizlet a learning based software.

This is a reusable game which means anything can be on the cards not just numbers, So it may be used within revision.

Also, I have added a timer and a restart button added so that you can see how fast you have completed the game.
